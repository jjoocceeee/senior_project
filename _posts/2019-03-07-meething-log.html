Our goal from last week to complete trading strategies was a bit ambitious since noone was able to complete them. They are the focus of work for over Spring Break.

    This upcoming Friday (tomorrow), we have the initial project proposal due. This will be written and completed by our team.

    Good news for this week: We recieved funding for our project of over $900. This will help us build the algorithms we need and buy the hardware.
